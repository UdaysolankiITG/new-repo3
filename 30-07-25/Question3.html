  🧩 Question: Sum the Indexes of Palindrome Words in a Sentence

  ✅ Task: 
  Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the sum of the indexes of the words that are palindromes.

  📌 Instructions:
  - Create a function with a meaningful name 
  - The function should accept a string (sentence) as input.
  - It should return a number — the sum of the indexes of words that are palindromes.
  - A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
  - Ignore case (e.g., "Level" should be treated as "level").

  📝 Input Example:
  let sentence = "madam level car racecar apple";

  🧮 Word List with Indexes:
  0: "madam"     ✅  
  1: "level"     ✅  
  2: "car"       ❌  
  3: "racecar"   ✅  
  4: "apple"     ❌  

  🎯 Expected Output:
  0 + 1 + 3 = 4

        let arr = str.split(" ");
        let count = 0;
        for (let i of arr) {
        if(arr[i]%3==0){
           count++ ;
        }}
       let sum = count;
       return sum ;
    };
     let sentence = "madam level car racecar apple";
